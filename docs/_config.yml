# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Cat from space is a personal blog which aims to tell the story of my career jump, from being a small animal veterinarian to becoming a software developer. As you can imagine, this choice was full of all challenges, frustrations and difficulties that deep changes can bring, but also a lot of fun and joy. I would also like to pay special attention to mental health and more light-hearted topics like arts. Enjoy!
