My name is Patricia, I was born and raised in the sunny coast of Spain, where I also obtained my Veterinary medicine degree as well as a Masters degree in Sciences teaching. But my adventurous side was screaming for something different from what I had known all my life, so I ended up looking for job in the UK, where I am now based. At the same time, I started a certificate in Small animal Surgery.

I have been practising as a small animal Veterinary Surgeon for around 6 years, but after dealing with burnout in the profession, I decided to quit my job and pursue a career as a software developer. I started learning to program a couple of years ago but am still on a very early stage.

I have many hobbies including drawing and painting, writing, going for walks in nature, singing, reading, drinking tea, going to gigs and seeing my wonderful friends!

Cat from space started as a way of documenting a journey I never thought I would make. Making a career change from a profession I adore and have dedicated around ten years of my life but that was having a too high toll on my health to something that interests me but I barely knew anything about. I would also like this to become a way of helping other people out there which are going through similar things, whether it is burnout, other mental-health issues, problems deciding what they want to do with their lives or that are curious about what being a vet or what being a programmer means.
