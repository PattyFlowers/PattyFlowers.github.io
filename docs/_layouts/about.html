My name is Patricia, I was born in the sunny coast of Spain and spend 27 years there, but my adventurous side was screaming for something different. So life ended up taking me to the UK, and I am loving it here! 
I have many hobbies including drawing and painting, writing, going for walks in nature, singing, reading, drinking tea, going to gigs and seeing my wonderful friends.

Cat from space started as a way of documenting a journey I never thought I would make. Making a career change from a profession I adore and have dedicated around ten years of my life but that was having a too high toll on my health to something that interests me but I barely knew anything about. I would also like this to help other people out there which are going through similar things, whether it is burnout, other mental-health issues, problems deciding what they want to do with their lives or that are curious about what being a vet or what being a programmer means.
