After writing a very long post about my [first day](https://www.catfromspace.com/programming/learning/story/2022/09/18/first-day-at-makers-academy.html) and what my [first week](https://www.catfromspace.com/programming/learning/story/2022/09/18/first-week-at-makers-academy.html) was like at Makers Academy, I wanted to write a last one about the things I learnt. I know what you are thinking and yes, it's a lot of writing for only the first week week, and my intention was to make only one post, but I wrote a lot and ended up having to do three different posts instead. C'est la vie!

One of the first things we were told at Makers Academy is that we have three main responsabilities regarding our learning:
- We are responsible for choosing what to aim for (our goals)
- For deciding how we are going to get there (our plan)
- And we need to get insight into how we are doing and prove to ourselves that we have reached those goals (self-assessment)
  

## Course goals

These are the proposed goals we have been given for the entire duration of the course:

# I can make software

* I can TDD anything
* I can program fluently
* I can debug anything
* I can model anything
* I can refactor anything
* I have a methodical approach to solving problems

# I'm equipped for long term growth

* I manage my own wellbeing
* I can learn anything by myself

# I help my teams succeed

* I use an agile product development process
* I write code that is easy to change
* I can justify the way I work
* I grow collaboratively
