A couple of years back the idea of a career change started to develop within me, but I wasn't too sure of how to do this. Since being a kid, I have been taught to follow a clear and structured guide of how to become a productive adult: Go to Primary school, go to High school, finish a degree at University, get as best grades as you can in all the previous, find a job and work in the same company for the rest of your life.
But the current job industry, at least in our generation, is far from the idealized career that my family presented me with.

When I started learning some programming through websites like JetBrains, Codeacademy and The Odin Projects, it was all really good fun and I felt like I was learning a lot and putting my problem-solving brain to work in something it enjoyed, but also that most of what I was learning was very isolated from real-life situations, from creating an app or working with somebody else on a project.

It was then when a friend told me the story of how the Makers Academy Software Development bootcamp had helped her launch her tech career from scratch as well as being a wonderful personal experience that allowed her to meet a lot of interesting people and learn to prioritise her wellbeing. 

As a general warning, there are a lot of scam bootcamps out there that promise you to refund the course if you do not find a job within some months, but usually the conditions are abusive (for example having to apply to 10 jobs a day during those months, clearly it's quite likely that if you do that someone will end up giving you a chance). I would advise you to read quite a few reviews before deciding to invest a large sum of money into something like that, and if possible, talking to some people who have gone through it and asking key questions about their experience.

So I decided to apply to this course and a very nice lady called me for a chat and explained a few things about the course, precourse and requirements to apply. They are quite restrictive regarding what people do the course, as they don't want people to drop out mid-way through

 and was asked to complete the free [Codeacademy Ruby course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) and then earn 100 honours in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). I completed these steps in about a couple of weeks and then wen
